# ColorPicker

This tool just take the hex value from the current pixel on the mouse, the idea is to simplify the developers life,
when the a new design or want to know the hex value of a color. Instead of open a graphical software just to take
the color value we can use this simple tool to get it.


# How to use

Just run this jar, it will open a dialog with the current pixel color value, in hex.
With current pixel I mean, the current pixel on mouse's tip.

Setup your system to run the code bellow when you press a shortcut.

`java -jar colorpicker.jar`
